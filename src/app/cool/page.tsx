      Hiya, I'm William and I like linguistics and langauges a lot - which is why I really want to go into NLP. Somethng really interesting I've noticed recently while studying Japanese was the fact the it does not have a basic word for 'is': even thought most people learn it as 'だ', it's actually a composition of the components 'で' (within) and 'ある' (exists). So the equivalent of 'is' is basically identical to the mathematical 'is a set of', which is the actual mathematical meaning if 'is' in most langugages as opposed to 'equivalent to' 🤯.
